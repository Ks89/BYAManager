![alt tag](http://www.stefanocappa.it/publicfiles/Github_repositories_images/BYAManager/0-header.jpg)


BYAManager is a personal project that i realized in 2011, and updated more times during the last years. It's a Multi-Platform and Multi-Language In the menu bar you can c Manager dedicated to the "Apple World", that i developed for the blog biteyourapple.net.
This software is a GUI to download iOS firmwares and iTunes versions with some extra features. 
It's legal, obviously, because all files are on Apple server. BYAManager bring files directly from Apple server for you.

It's available in 3 languages: ITALIAN, ENGLISH and CZECH

The entire list of features is available [HERE](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAManager#features).

BYAManager uses BYAUpdater to update itself automatically!

**This software requires Java 8 or above and an internet connection**


## Bug reports
ATTENTION: I'll never fix issues about the Graphical Interface, because i want to recreate the entire GUI with different technologies in the future.
