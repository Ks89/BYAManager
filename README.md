# BYAManager

![alt tag](http://www.stefanocappa.it/publicfiles/Github_repositories_images/BYAManager/0-header.jpg)

BYAManager is a personal project that i realized in 2011 and updated more times during the years. It's a Multi-Platform and Multi-Language software dedicated to the "Apple World", that i developed for the blog called BiteYourApple.<br/>
This software is a GUI to download iOS firmwares and iTunes versions with some extra features.<br/>
It's legal, obviously, because all files are on Apple server. BYAManager gets files directly from Apple server to you.<br/>

It's available in 3 languages: ITALIAN, ENGLISH and CZECH

The entire list of features is available [HERE](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAManager#features).

BYAManager uses [BYAUpdater](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAUpdater) to update itself automatically!

I presented this software in 2011 [HERE](http://www.biteyourapple.net/2011/12/28/esclusiva-bya-biteyourapple-manager-beta-3/)

Attention!!! I started this project on assembla.com with SVN. The source code and the commit's list are in Assembla in a private repository. This isn't important, because the code here on GitHub is better.


I'm working on a Python script to sort the ipsw's links in the database.<br/>
This project is available [HERE](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAMSorter). <br/>
In the future, i want to integrate this script in BYAManager.

**This software requires Java 8 or above and an internet connection**


## Bug reports
ATTENTION: I'll never fix issues about the Graphical Interface, because i want to recreate the entire GUI with different technologies in the future.
